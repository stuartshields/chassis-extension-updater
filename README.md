# Extension Updater Beta
The purpose of this extension is to find out a way to update existing Extensions for Chassis with the hope it'll be merged into Chassis Core in the future.

## Basis

The idea is to compare how many commits have been made since last `pull`. We will use [GitHub's API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/commits/#compare-two-commits)
